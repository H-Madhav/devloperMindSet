# Project : Establishing Developer Mindset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Write a letter to your future self using what you’ve learned. How will 
you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you 
tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth 
mindset help you reach your goals?

2. Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These 
goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a 
dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching 
to start working on?

# Letter to MySelf

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Self,

I know you are struggling this time with your assignment but in case i 
don't tell you enough,you have everything to figure this out but you have 
to identify them.Anyway this is not going to be easy and you know this.So 
what to do ...

-Quit ? **definitely not** because “learning to code is hard”. Recall the 
"growth mindset" from Joyce Akiko's "How To Navigate The Up And Downs Of 
Learning To Code". Set your mind right.Rather than focusing on the job you 
want, focus on the problems you want to solve.This keeps your energy on the 
results.Try to do something that makes you feel good.It may be music or 
something else.

I know you.You want some more suggetions:

1.  When you hit a problem, check your thoughts.Try to find out what can I 
learn from this? How can I improve?

2.  Don’t tally up successes and. setbacks. Instead, focus on all the 
things that you learned that day and imagine all the things you will learn 
tomorrow.

3.  Instead of comparing yourself to people who are farther along, think 
about how hard those people had to work to get      where they are today.

With the growth mindset, you can get off the roller coaster ride of massive 
ups and downs.

Best , Hari
